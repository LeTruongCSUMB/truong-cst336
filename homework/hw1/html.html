                <h3>What is HTML?</h3>
                <p id="info">HTML or HyperText Markup Language is the standard markup language to create web pages
                using formats for texts and images in how they will be displayed on web browsers.This is
                called "rich" text, where there were formatting and visual iamges, making the website "rich"
                in text. HTML was created in 1990 by physicist Tim Berners-Lee who made it to share documents 
                with fellow scientists online, which before was just plain text.</p>
                
                <h3>Why is HTML Important?</h3>
                <p id="info">HTML is important as it allows our electronic documents or pages to be displayed
                online. Almost every page that is online uses HTML and it's formatting allowed all
                pages on the web to be diverse and unique. Without HTML all pages on the web would 
                look bland and unformatted, giving out an unappealing look, and no one would stay on
                an unappealing page would you?
