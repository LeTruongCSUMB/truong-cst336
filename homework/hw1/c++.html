                <h3>What is C++?</h3>
                <p id="info">C++ is a general-purpose, object-oriented, high-level programming language
                an extension of the C language. Being an extension allows C++ to be coded in
                "C style" or in regular C++ format. C++ was released in 1985 and was originally 
                considered as an object-oriented version of C language. C++ is much more effcient
                when it came to coding and compiling, and has become one of the major programming
                languages in computer science, surpassing its predecessor, C language</p>
                
                <h3>Why is C++ Important?</h3>
                <p id="info">C++ is a language used to create computer programs that vary from packaged software to
                videogames, office applications, graphics, vido editors and even operating systems. Its
                wide spread use of throught many machines is why it is often the first programming language 
                to be taught at a college level, often alongside the other program language giant,
