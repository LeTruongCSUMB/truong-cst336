                <h3>What is PHP?</h3>
                <p id="info">PHP is an open source scripting language that could also be used as a
                general-purpose programming language. PHP was created to make web pages
                more dynamic much like HTML makes web pages formatted. PHP was released
                in 1995 as aserver-side scripting language, where the code is sent and
                processed by the server and convert to become a website in HTML.</p>
                
                <h3>Why is PHP Important?</h3>
                <p id="info">PHP is used primarily to help data-heavy websites collect form data.
                PHP can also be used in app development as to aid in generating dynamic
                page contents. PHP, like HTML, is used on all majot operating systems and
                web servers, and its open source allows programmers the ease of not having
