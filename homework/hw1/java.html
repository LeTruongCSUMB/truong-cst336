                <h3>What is Java?</h3>
                <p id="info">Java is a general-purpose, object-oriented, high-level programming languages
                which is known primarily for it's principle of WORA, or Write Once Run Anywhere.
                The program was originally called Oak, and was initially developed in 1990 at 
                Sun Microsystems by James Gosling, Mike Sheridan and Patrick Naughton, as a way of 
                adding additional features for <a href="c++.html" style="color: #85929E">c++</a>. 
                Java was publicly released in May 23, 1995 and has been one of the largest languages
                in the field of Computer Science.</p>
                
                <h3>Why is Java Important?</h3>
                <p id="info">Java is important mainly due to the WORA principle, it makes the codes easily available
                to as many machines without the need of changing the code. This has allowed it to be used
                in video games, mobile apps, and webpages called Java Server Pages which allows applets
                to be downloaded and used through any browser that a program can't usually do.
